## What is ForgeAI?

ForgeAI is a **production-ready, fully self-hosted AI assistant platform** built from scratch in TypeScript. It connects your AI to WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Google Chat, WebChat, and **IoT/embedded devices** via the Node Protocol — all managed through a modern 17-page dashboard.

Unlike cloud-based AI services, ForgeAI runs **entirely on your machine**. Your conversations, API keys, and personal data never leave your network. Every secret is encrypted with AES-256-GCM, every action is logged in an immutable audit trail, and every request passes through 9 security modules before reaching the agent.

```

## Why ForgeAI?

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### 🔒 Security-First Architecture
9 security modules active by default. AES-256-GCM encrypted vault, RBAC, rate limiting, prompt injection detection, input sanitization, 2FA, **Email OTP** for external access, and immutable audit logging. **First-run Setup Wizard** guides you through SMTP, 2FA, and admin PIN configuration. Smart IP detection automatically applies stricter authentication for external (VPS/internet) access. Your API keys and tokens are **never** stored in plain text.

### 🌐 True Multi-Channel
One AI, every platform. WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Google Chat, WebChat, and IoT devices via Node Protocol. Each channel gets real-time progress updates, typing indicators, and automatic message chunking.

### 🤖 Autonomous Agent
The agentic loop runs up to **25 iterations** per request. The agent browses the web, executes code, manages files, takes screenshots, schedules tasks, and communicates with other agents — all without human intervention.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### 🔄 10 LLM Providers with Auto-Failover
Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Moonshot/Kimi, DeepSeek, xAI/Grok, Groq, Mistral, **Local LLMs** (Ollama), and **OpenAI-Compatible** (LM Studio/llama.cpp/vLLM). Circuit breaker per provider, exponential backoff, automatic fallback chain. Cloud ↔ local failover — if all cloud providers go down, your local model picks up.

### 📊 Full Observability
17-page dashboard with real-time WebSocket updates (including RAG management, Voice, and more). See what the agent is thinking, which tools it's calling, how much it costs, and the credit balance remaining on each provider. OpenTelemetry traces and metrics built-in.

### 🧩 Extensible Everything
Plugin SDK for custom behaviors. MCP Client for external tool servers. Workflow engine for multi-step automation. RAG engine for document search. REST API with 140+ endpoints for full programmatic control.

All model lists are **configurable per provider** via the dashboard Settings page or the `POST /api/providers/:name/models` API endpoint. Custom models are stored encrypted in Vault.

Every provider has **circuit breaker** protection (5-failure threshold, 2-minute cooldown), **exponential backoff** retries, and **automatic failover** to the next provider in the chain.

> **💡 Subscription-Based API Access (Anthropic)**
> You don't need a pay-as-you-go API key to use Claude. If you have a **Claude Pro**, **Max**, or **CLI** subscription plan, you can use the API key tied to your plan. ForgeAI treats it like any other Anthropic key — just paste it in Dashboard → Settings → Anthropic. The billing goes through your existing subscription instead of per-token charges. This is especially useful for accessing **Claude Opus 4.6** at a fixed monthly cost.

### Security Modules (9)

```
Request ──→ [Rate Limiter] ──→ [IP Filter] ──→ [JWT Auth] ──→ [RBAC] ──→ [Input Sanitizer] ──→ [Prompt Guard] ──→ Agent
                                    │                                                                  ↓
                              [Smart IP Detection]                                          [Audit Log] (every action)
                              Local? → PIN + 2FA                                            [Vault] (encrypted secrets)
                              External? → PIN + 2FA + Email OTP (4-factor)
```

| Module | Implementation |
|:-------|:---------------|
| **Credential Vault** | AES-256-GCM encryption, PBKDF2 key derivation (310k iterations), file-persistent |
| **RBAC** | Role-based (admin/user/guest) per resource, per tool, per endpoint |
| **Rate Limiter** | 12 rules: per-user, per-channel, per-tool, per-IP. Sliding window + burst |
| **Prompt Injection Guard** | 6 patterns: direct injection, role hijacking, encoding, delimiters, context manipulation, multi-language |
| **Input Sanitizer** | Blocks XSS, SQL injection, command injection, path traversal |
| **2FA (TOTP)** | Time-based one-time passwords via Google Authenticator, Authy, etc. |
| **Email OTP** | 6-digit verification codes sent to admin email for external access (5-min expiry, rate-limited) |
| **Audit Log** | Immutable, 4 risk levels (low/medium/high/critical), queryable via API + Dashboard |
| **Setup Wizard** | First-run guided setup: SMTP, 2FA, admin PIN — no config files needed |

#### Smart Local vs External Detection

ForgeAI automatically detects whether the request comes from **localhost** (`127.0.0.1` / `::1`) or an **external IP** (VPS, internet). Based on this:

| Access Type | Authentication Flow |
|:------------|:-------------------|
| **Local** (localhost) | Access Token → PIN → TOTP |
| **External** (VPS/internet) | Access Token → PIN → TOTP → **Email OTP** (4-factor) |

This means running ForgeAI on a **VPS** is just as secure as running it locally — external requests require an additional email verification step automatically, with no extra configuration.

### 🖥️ Electron Desktop App

Native desktop wrapper (`packages/desktop`) for Windows, macOS, and Linux:
- **System Tray** — runs in background, double-click to show, context menu with quick actions
- **Global Hotkeys** — `Ctrl+Shift+F` toggle window, `Ctrl+Shift+C` quick chat
- **Native Notifications** — OS-level notifications for agent events
- **Auto-Update** — automatic updates via GitHub Releases (electron-updater)
- **Startup on Boot** — optional auto-start with OS
- **Single Instance** — prevents multiple windows
- **Minimize to Tray** — close button minimizes instead of quitting
- **Persistent Settings** — gateway URL, window bounds, preferences stored in user data

### 🔥 ForgeAI Companion (Windows)

Lightweight native desktop client (`packages/companion`) built with **Tauri 2 + React + Rust**. Connects to any ForgeAI Gateway (local or remote) and lets you interact with the AI directly from your desktop.

> **⚠️ Windows exclusive** — requires Windows 10/11 (x64). The Companion connects to the Gateway via HTTP/WebSocket, so the Gateway itself can run on any platform (Linux VPS, Docker, etc.).

- **Pairing System** — connect to any Gateway with URL + pairing code (generated in Dashboard → Settings)
- **Real-time Agent Progress** — WebSocket connection shows live tool execution (which tool is being called, success/failure) instead of just a loading spinner
- **Tool Step Display** — collapsible tool execution history in each message (tool name, ✓/✗ status, duration)
- **Screenshot Viewer** — click to expand fullscreen, download button, supports both local and remote Gateway screenshots
- **Voice Mode** — push-to-talk with waveform visualizer, wake word detection ("Hey Forge"), STT → AI → TTS pipeline
- **Config Sync** — securely transfer all Gateway configurations (LLM keys, TTS settings, system config) between Gateways using encrypted one-time sync codes
- **System Tray** — minimize to tray, single instance enforcement
- **Smart Safety System** — Rust-based security layer protects OS-critical paths (C:\Windows, System32, boot files) while allowing full file operations everywhere else
- **Desktop Automation** — the AI agent can create folders, delete files, launch apps, take screenshots, and run shell commands on the machine running the Companion
- **Dual Environment Routing** — the AI has access to **two machines simultaneously**: the Linux server (Gateway) and your Windows PC (Companion). Use `target="server"` or `target="companion"` on `shell_exec` and `file_manager` to choose where commands execute. The agent auto-detects intent from keywords like "meu computador", "my pc", "windows", etc.
- **Streaming Heartbeat** — long-running agent tasks (multi-step website creation, complex automation) never timeout. The Gateway sends periodic heartbeats to keep the HTTP connection alive, then delivers the final result. No more "Gateway request failed" errors regardless of task complexity.

#### Quick Start (Companion)

```powershell
# Option 1: Install from .msi or .exe installer
# Download from GitHub Releases → ForgeAI Companion_1.0.0_x64-setup.exe

# Option 2: Build from source
pnpm --filter @forgeai/companion build
# Outputs: packages/companion/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/
```

1. Launch the Companion
2. Enter your Gateway URL (e.g. `http://192.168.1.100:18800` or `http://your-vps-ip:18800`)
3. Enter the pairing code from **Dashboard → Settings → Companion Pairing**
4. Start chatting — the AI can now control your Windows desktop

#### Config Sync (Transfer Settings Between Gateways)

Securely migrate all your configurations from one Gateway to another without manual reconfiguration:

1. **On the destination Gateway** (e.g. VPS): Go to Companion Settings or Dashboard → Config Sync → click **"Generate Sync Code"**
2. A one-time 8-character code is generated (valid for 5 minutes)
3. **On the source Gateway** (e.g. your local machine): Enter the destination URL + sync code → click **"Push Config"**
4. All Vault data (LLM API keys, TTS config, system settings) is encrypted with AES-256-GCM using the sync code as the key, transmitted, and imported on the destination

Security: codes are single-use, expire in 5 minutes, rate-limited to 3 attempts per 5 minutes. Data is encrypted independently of the Vault encryption — the sync code never travels alongside the encrypted data.

#### Dual Environment Routing

When a Companion is connected, the AI agent can control **two machines simultaneously**:

```
┌──────────────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────────────┐
│   SERVER (Linux/Docker)   │     │   COMPANION (Windows PC)  │
│                           │     │                           │
│  • Bash commands          │     │  • PowerShell commands    │
│  • Linux paths (/home/..) │     │  • Windows paths (C:\...) │
│  • Web hosting            │     │  • Desktop automation     │
│  • Default execution      │     │  • GUI control            │
│                           │     │                           │
│  target="server" (default)│     │  target="companion"       │
└──────────────────────────┘     └──────────────────────────┘
```

The agent automatically detects routing intent from keywords:
- **Server (default)**: "no linux", "no servidor", "on the server"
- **Companion**: "meu computador", "minha máquina", "meu pc", "my computer", "my desktop", "windows"
- **Desktop tool** (screenshot, GUI): always routes to Companion (server has no GUI)

### 🌐 Domain / HTTPS (Native)

ForgeAI includes **built-in domain support** with automatic HTTPS via [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) reverse proxy. No external setup required — just run a single script.

```bash
# Interactive setup — validates DNS, checks ports, configures everything
bash scripts/setup-domain.sh
```

The script:
1. Asks for your domain (e.g., `ai.example.com`)
2. Verifies DNS A record points to your server
3. Checks that ports 80/443 are available
4. Configures `.env` with `DOMAIN` and `PUBLIC_URL`
5. Starts Caddy with automatic Let's Encrypt SSL
6. Rebuilds the Gateway with the correct public URL

**Or configure manually:**

```bash
# 1. Set domain in .env
echo "DOMAIN=ai.example.com" >> .env
echo "PUBLIC_URL=https://ai.example.com" >> .env

# 2. Start with domain profile
docker compose --profile domain up -d
```

| Feature | Details |
|:--------|:--------|
| **SSL** | Automatic via Let's Encrypt (zero config) |
| **Security Headers** | HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy |
| **WebSocket** | Full support (Companion, real-time updates) |
| **Timeouts** | Configured for long agent operations |
| **Revert** | Remove `DOMAIN` from `.env` → `docker compose --profile domain down` → `docker compose up -d` |

### 📦 Static Site Hosting

The Gateway automatically serves static websites created by the agent. No extra ports, no HTTP servers to start.

**How it works:**
1. Agent creates files in `.forgeai/workspace/<project-name>/`
2. Files are instantly accessible at `http://<server>:18800/sites/<project-name>/`
3. With a domain: `https://yourdomain.com/sites/<project-name>/`

```
User: "create a landing page for my startup"

Agent creates:
  .forgeai/workspace/startup-landing/
  ├── index.html
  ├── style.css
  └── script.js

Accessible at: https://yourdomain.com/sites/startup-landing/
```

- Supports HTML, CSS, JS, images, fonts, videos, PDFs
- Directory index (`index.html`) served automatically
- No authentication required (sites are public)
- 5-minute cache for fast loading
- CORS enabled for cross-origin access

## � Node Protocol (IoT/Embedded Devices)

Connect lightweight devices to your AI via WebSocket. A single Go binary (~5MB, zero dependencies) turns any Linux board into an AI-powered node.

<details>

Message Flow:
  Device sends text → NodeChannel → AgentManager → LLM → Response → Device
  Gateway sends command → NodeChannel → Device executes → Result → Gateway
  Device A → relay → NodeChannel → Device B (node-to-node)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🔑 Key Management</b></summary>

The Node Protocol API key is managed entirely via the **Dashboard** (no `.env` needed):

1. **Dashboard → Settings → Node Protocol** → Click **"Generate Secure Key"**
2. Key is encrypted with **AES-256-GCM** and stored in Vault
3. Key persists across Gateway restarts
4. **Hot-reload** — changing the key instantly reconfigures the NodeChannel (no restart needed)
5. Connection instructions and copyable CLI command shown directly in Dashboard

API endpoints:
- `POST /api/nodes/generate-key` — Generate new key
- `GET /api/nodes/connection-info` — Get WebSocket URL + CLI example
- `GET /api/nodes` — List connected nodes
- `POST /api/nodes/:id/command` — Execute command on a device

## 🗺 Roadmap

### Completed — 26 Phases

All core features are implemented and tested:

- **Security** — 9 modules, encrypted vault, RBAC, rate limiting, prompt guard, 2FA, Email OTP (external access), setup wizard, audit
- **Agent** — Multi-LLM router (10 providers incl. Ollama + OpenAI-Compatible), agentic loop (25 iter), thinking levels, failover + circuit breaker
- **Channels** — WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Teams, Google Chat, WebChat, Node Protocol (IoT)
- **Tools** — 13 built-in + MCP Client + Puppeteer + Shell + Sandbox
- **Dashboard** — 17 pages, WebSocket real-time, provider balance tracking
- **Multimodal** — Vision input (image analysis), Voice STT/TTS, Image generation (DALL-E 3, Leonardo AI, Stable Diffusion)
- **Integrations** — GitHub, Gmail, Google Calendar, Notion, RSS
- **Advanced** — RAG, AutoPlanner, Workflows, Memory, Autopilot, DM Pairing, Multi-Agent
- **Infrastructure** — Docker, CI/CD, E2E tests, OpenTelemetry, GDPR, OAuth2, IP filtering
- **Node Protocol** — Lightweight Go binary (~5MB) for embedded devices (Raspberry Pi, Jetson, BeagleBone, NanoKVM). WebSocket connection to Gateway, auth, heartbeat, remote command execution, system info reporting, node-to-node relay. Key management via Dashboard (encrypted Vault, hot-reload). Cross-compilation for Linux ARM/AMD64, Windows, macOS
- **Security Hardening** — Startup integrity check, generic webhook alerts, audit log rotation, RBAC hard enforcement (403 block for non-admin authenticated users)
- **First-Run Setup Wizard** — Guided setup on first access: SMTP configuration with test connection, 2FA (TOTP) with QR code, admin PIN change. Smart local/external IP detection with 4-factor auth for VPS/external access (Access Token + PIN + TOTP + Email OTP). Email OTP service with styled HTML emails, 5-minute expiry, rate limiting. SMTP config manageable from Dashboard Settings
- **Configurable Models** — All 10 provider model lists updated to latest (GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.6, Grok 4, etc.), configurable per provider via dashboard + API, stored encrypted in Vault
- **Browser Tools Upgrade** — Puppeteer: 21 actions (scroll, hover, select, cookies, multi-tab, extract_table). web_browse: HTTP methods, headers, tables/metadata/json. New web_search tool (Google/DuckDuckGo)
- **RAG Engine Upgrade** — Persistence (JSON to disk, auto-load on startup), runtime config API, file upload (PDF/TXT/MD/code), OpenAI embeddings support, dashboard RAG page
- **Cross-Platform Desktop** — Full macOS support (AppleScript, Vision OCR, screencapture), Linux improvements (Wayland, tesseract OCR, dependency detection), file manager with full system access (absolute paths, copy/move/search/permissions/disk_info), CLI ASCII banner
- **ForgeAI Companion** — Tauri 2 + React + Rust native Windows client. Pairing system, real-time WebSocket agent progress, tool step display, screenshot viewer with fullscreen + download, voice mode with wake word, Config Sync, system tray, smart Rust safety system, desktop automation
- **Config Sync** — Secure gateway-to-gateway configuration transfer. AES-256-GCM encryption with one-time 8-char sync codes (5-min TTL), rate-limited, audit-logged. Transfer all Vault data (LLM keys, TTS, system config) between Gateways
- **Smart File Security** — Agent can delete folders/files anywhere EXCEPT OS-critical paths (C:\Windows, System32, boot, recovery). Shell commands blocked for drive-root wipes and system directory destruction. Rust safety layer in Companion with protected paths, processes, and registry keys
- **Dual Environment Routing** — `target` parameter on `shell_exec` and `file_manager` tools: `target="server"` (default, Linux/Bash) or `target="companion"` (Windows/PowerShell). CompanionToolExecutor conditionally delegates based on target. Agent auto-detects routing from user intent keywords
- **Streaming Heartbeat** — Gateway sends periodic heartbeat spaces during long agent processing to keep HTTP connections alive. Companion reads full response, trims heartbeats, parses final JSON. Eliminates timeout errors on complex multi-step tasks regardless of duration
- **Static Site Hosting** — `/sites/*` route on Gateway serves static files from `.forgeai/workspace/` with directory index support. Agent creates websites directly in workspace, instantly accessible via public URL. No HTTP server needed, no extra ports
- **Native Domain / HTTPS** — Built-in Caddy reverse proxy with automatic Let's Encrypt SSL. Docker Compose profile (`--profile domain`). Interactive `setup-domain.sh` script validates DNS, checks ports, configures `.env`, and deploys. Security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.) included
